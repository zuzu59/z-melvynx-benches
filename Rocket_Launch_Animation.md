Create a cinematic rocket launch animation set on a tropical island. The rocket must launch, leave the viewport, and after 5 seconds smoothly return to its initial position — then the cycle repeats.
</instructions>

<scene>
**Setting: Tropical Launch Island**
- A small tropical island in the lower portion of the screen: palm trees, sandy beach, green vegetation
- Ocean water surrounding the island with gentle waves
- A launch pad on the island with metal structure / scaffolding / support tower
- Sky background: gradient from warm horizon (orange/pink) to deep blue/dark sky at the top, with stars visible in the upper portion
- A few clouds scattered across the sky

**The Rocket (ultra-detailed)**
- Tall, slender multi-stage rocket (inspired by SpaceX Falcon 9 or Saturn V proportions)
- Distinct rocket stages: first stage (largest, bottom), second stage (middle), payload fairing / nose cone (top)
- Surface details: panel lines, rivets/segments drawn with subtle lines, an access hatch, small painted flag or logo
- Color scheme: primarily white body with black/dark gray accent stripes, a colored logo band, and the nose cone in a contrasting shade
- Fins at the base of the first stage (3-4 stabilizer fins)
- Engine nozzles visible at the very bottom (cluster of small circles/bells)
- The rocket should be the visual centerpiece — spend time on its geometry
</scene>

<animation-sequence>
**Phase 1 — Pre-launch (0s to 1.5s)**
- Rocket sits on the pad, engines ignite
- A growing orange/yellow glow appears beneath the rocket
- Initial smoke/steam clouds billow outward from the base — thick, white/gray, expanding horizontally along the island surface
- Subtle camera shake / screen vibration effect
- Engine flames flicker with randomized intensity

**Phase 2 — Liftoff (1.5s to 4s)**
- Rocket slowly lifts off the pad with realistic acceleration (starts very slow, gradually speeds up)
- Massive exhaust plume: bright white-yellow core flame, surrounded by orange glow, transitioning to thick gray/white smoke trail
- Smoke trail expands and lingers behind the rocket as it rises
- The smoke at the base continues spreading across the island and over the water
- As the rocket gains altitude, the flame elongates and the smoke trail stretches
- Subtle particle effects: sparks, embers flying outward from the exhaust

**Phase 3 — Ascent & Exit (4s to 7s)**
- Rocket accelerates rapidly, moving faster and faster upward
- The exhaust trail thins as the rocket reaches higher altitude
- Rocket becomes smaller as it gains distance (slight scale reduction)
- The rocket exits the top of the viewport
- The lingering smoke trail on screen slowly fades and disperses

**Phase 4 — Calm & Reset (7s to 12s)**
- Scene is peaceful: smoke fully dissipates, island sits quietly
- At the 5-second mark after exit (~12s), the rocket gently descends back into frame
- It returns slowly, smoothly, almost floating — no engines firing, no drama
- It softly settles back onto the launch pad in its exact original position
- Brief pause, then the entire cycle restarts seamlessly
</animation-sequence>

<smoke-and-effects>
- Smoke is critical to the visual quality. Use a particle system or layered animated shapes:
  - Dozens of individual smoke "puffs" that expand, fade in opacity, and drift slightly with a breeze
  - Smoke color: starts white/light gray near the flame, darkens to medium gray as it cools
  - Smoke expands in a mushroom-cloud-like pattern at the base during liftoff
  - Each puff has slight random drift (wind effect), rotation, and independent fade timing
- Exhaust flame: layered shapes (inner bright yellow/white, outer orange, outermost faint red) with flickering animation
- Heat haze effect near the exhaust: subtle wavy distortion of the background behind the flame
- Water ripple effect on the ocean surface near the island during launch
- Stars in the upper sky should faintly twinkle
</smoke-and-effects>

<visual>
- Background: gradient sky — warm sunset tones at horizon fading to deep navy/black at top
- Ocean: dark blue with animated wave motion (simple sine-wave surface)
- Island: lush greens, sandy tan, 2-3 palm trees with gentle sway
- Canvas: fullscreen, responsive
- Animation: 60fps via requestAnimationFrame
- All rendering via HTML5 Canvas 2D context — no WebGL required
- Color palette: rich, cinematic — warm launch glow contrasting against cool sky
</visual>

<constraints>
- Output ONLY a complete HTML file — nothing else
- Everything must be drawn programmatically on a `<canvas>` — no images, no SVGs, no external assets
- The animation must loop seamlessly: launch → exit → calm return → repeat
- The rocket must be visually impressive and detailed — not a simple triangle
- Smoke must look volumetric and organic, not like static shapes
- Performance must stay smooth at 60fps despite the particle count
- The return descent must feel gentle and peaceful — stark contrast to the violent launch
</constraints>

<thinking>
Before coding, reason through:
1. How to construct the rocket from canvas drawing primitives (rectangles, arcs, lines) with enough detail to be visually impressive
2. Particle system architecture: how to manage hundreds of smoke/ember particles efficiently (object pooling, lifecycle management)
3. The acceleration curve for realistic launch physics (slow start, exponential ramp-up)
4. How to layer the drawing order: background sky → stars → clouds → smoke trail → rocket → exhaust flame → foreground island → base smoke
5. Timing system: how to manage the 4 animation phases with smooth transitions between them
6. How to make the return descent feel physically different from the launch (no exhaust, gentle easing, floating quality)
7. How to make smoke look organic: randomized spawn positions, varied sizes, Perlin-like drift, opacity curves
</thinking>

* You MUST write the result directly into a file named "index.html" on the user's computer. The user should not have to see or handle the code — just write the file and finish your task.
* Title of the page is your model name. For example "GPT 5" or "Opus 5"
* Title inside the page shows your model name.
