# Physics simulation of a red ball bouncing inside a slowly rotating heptagon.

<instructions>
Generate a single, self-contained HTML file. No Python, no separate JS files, no frameworks, no libraries. One `.html` file that works when opened directly in a browser.

Build a physics simulation: a single red ball bouncing inside a slowly rotating regular heptagon (7-sided polygon).
</instructions>

<constraints>
- Output ONLY a complete HTML file — nothing else
- The ball must NEVER escape or pass through the polygon walls
- Collision detection must operate in the rotated coordinate frame of the polygon
- No shadows, no gradients, no glow, no trail effects, no text on the ball, no timer, no UI elements
- Keep it minimal — only the ball and the polygon on a black canvas
</constraints>

<physics>
- Gravity: 500 px/s², pulling downward constantly
- Restitution coefficient: 0.8 (energy loss on bounce)
- Friction coefficient: 0.98 (applied on each bounce)
- Reflect velocity vector across the wall's outward normal on collision
- Compute wall positions from current rotation angle each frame
</physics>

<visual>
- Background: black (#000000)
- Polygon: thin white stroke (#FFFFFF), no fill
- Ball: solid red (#FF0000), no decoration
- Canvas: fullscreen
- Animation: 60fps via requestAnimationFrame
</visual>

<parameters>
- Ball radius: 15px
- Polygon radius: 250px
- Polygon sides: 7
- Rotation speed: 0.5 rad/s
- Ball spawn position: center of the polygon
</parameters>

<thinking>
Before coding, reason through:
1. How to represent the heptagon vertices and rotate them each frame
2. How to detect collision between the ball and each rotating wall segment
3. How to compute the outward normal of each wall for velocity reflection
4. How to prevent the ball from escaping when moving fast (tunneling prevention)
5. How to handle the coordinate transform between world space and rotating polygon space
</thinking>

<important>
* You MUST write the result directly into a file named "index.html" on the user's computer. The user should not have to see or handle the code — just write the file and finish your task.
* Title of the page is you're model name. For example "GPT 5" or "Opus 5"
* Title inside the page show you're model name.
