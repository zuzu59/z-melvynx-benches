<instructions>
Build a timezone overlap checker web app using a popular web framework of your choice. Do NOT use vanilla JS or a raw Node.js `http` server. The app must run with a single command (`npm run dev` or equivalent).

You have **full creative freedom** on everything: technology choices, code architecture, file structure, component separation, state management, styling approach, design system, and UX. Own every decision — make it clean, well-structured, and something you're proud of.

<purpose>
A tool for remote workers, distributed teams, and digital nomads who need to find common meeting windows or compare their schedule against colleagues in other timezones.
</purpose>

<modes>
The app has two modes the user can toggle between:

**Meeting Mode** (default)
Find hours when everyone across all selected cities is simultaneously awake. All cities share the same highlighted overlap window. Think: scheduling a group call where every participant must be available.

**Base Mode**
One city is the "base" (the reference). Each other city gets its own independent overlap calculated only against the base. Different cities may highlight different hours. Think: a person living in one city who works with people in several other cities and wants to see per-person availability.
</modes>

<cities>
- Users maintain a list of cities to compare. Default: San Francisco, Denpasar, Geneva.
- Cities come from a predefined catalog of ~34 cities spanning all major world regions (North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia, Oceania).
- Users add cities via a searchable dropdown (search by city name or country). Remove any city from the list. No duplicates allowed.
- No custom/arbitrary timezone entries — only the predefined catalog.
</cities>

<reference-city>
- The first city in the list is always the **reference city**, visually marked (e.g. a "REF" badge).
- All hour calculations are anchored to the reference city's timezone.
- Users can click any city's name to promote it as the new reference (it moves to the top).
- In Base Mode, overlap is computed between the reference city and each other city independently.
</reference-city>

<availability>
Users configure their personal "awake window" via a settings panel:

- **Wake-up hour** (0–23, default: 7)
- **Sleep hour** (0–23, default: 23)
- **Time format**: 12h or 24h (default: 12h)

The awake window applies uniformly to all cities (everyone shares the same sleep schedule). Overnight ranges are supported (e.g. wake at 22, sleep at 6 for night-shift workers). Changes take effect immediately.
</availability>

<grid>
The core visualization is a **24-column grid** (one column per hour of the reference city's day, 0–23).

Each cell shows what hour it is **locally** in that city when it's that column's hour in the reference city.

Three visual states per cell:
1. **Sleeping** — the local hour falls outside the awake window → faded/muted
2. **Awake, no overlap** — awake but not part of the overlap → neutral
3. **Overlap** — awake AND this hour qualifies as overlap → highlighted (e.g. green), bold text
</grid>

<overlap-summary>
Displayed above the grid when 2+ cities are present:

- **Meeting Mode**: total overlap hours count + time range(s) in the reference city's timezone. Zero overlap → warning message.
- **Base Mode**: one line per non-reference city, each with its own overlap count + time range(s). Zero overlap → individual warning.

Time ranges are inclusive start → exclusive end (e.g. "9am — 12pm" = hours 9, 10, 11). Non-contiguous windows are shown as separate badges/ranges.
</overlap-summary>

<timezone-math>
- UTC offsets derived from the current date → DST is automatically handled.
- Fractional offsets supported (e.g. India UTC+5:30, Nepal UTC+5:45).
- Each city displays its current UTC offset.
</timezone-math>

<responsive>
**Desktop (≥768px)**: cities as rows, hours as columns (horizontal grid). Left: city info + REF badge + UTC offset. Center: 24 hour cells. Right: remove button.

**Mobile (<768px)**: cities as columns, hours as rows (vertical layout). These are **two separate layouts**, not a single responsive grid.
</responsive>

<persistence>
All state (city list, settings, active mode) is persisted to localStorage. Refreshing restores the last configuration. A new browser/incognito session starts with defaults.
</persistence>

<defaults>
On first visit:
- 3 cities: San Francisco, Denpasar, Geneva
- Meeting mode active
- Awake window: 7am–11pm
- 12-hour format
- Overlap summary showing common availability across the 3 default cities
- A hint at the bottom: "Green cells = everyone awake"
</defaults>

<important>
- `<title>` and page heading must be your model name (e.g. "Claude Sonnet 4.5" or "GPT-4o")
- The grid must make overlaps **instantly obvious** — alignment is critical
- Full creative freedom on colors, typography, and visual style — design the best possible UI/UX
- Polished, production-quality — not a prototype
</important>
