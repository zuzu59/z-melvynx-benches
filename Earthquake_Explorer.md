# Build a live earthquake explorer with a real map, accurately positioned individual events, multiple exploration choices, visible colors, and interactive details.

<challenge>
Design and build the best possible application for exploring live earthquake activity around the world.

The goal is to create a genuinely useful, visually compelling experience that lets people understand where recent earthquakes happened and inspect them in more detail. Build the complete experience in the current repository using live USGS earthquake data.
</challenge>

<essential-outcomes>
The finished application must include:

- A real interactive geographic map with a visible basemap.
- Recent earthquakes shown individually on the map at their correct geographic coordinates.
- No marker clustering or grouped points: every earthquake remains its own visible, interactive point.
- Several meaningful choices for exploring or filtering the data.
- Interactive elements that can be selected to reveal details about the corresponding earthquake.
- A clear color system that is visible in the experience and helps communicate useful differences in the data.
- Fully functional interactions and real data rather than decorative or fictional results.
</essential-outcomes>

<data>
Use the free USGS Earthquake APIs. They require no API key.

You may use the real-time GeoJSON feeds:

https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

or the query API:

https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson

Use the returned coordinates for every point so each earthquake appears in its true location.
</data>

<creative-freedom>
Everything beyond the essential outcomes is up to you. Choose the layout, visual direction, interactions, controls, information hierarchy, responsive behavior, technology, and level of detail that produce the strongest result.

Do not explain your design before building it. Make the product decisions yourself, implement the experience, and refine it into a polished application.
</creative-freedom>

<success-criteria>
The result succeeds when users can see individual earthquakes in their correct positions on a real map, use multiple options to explore them, select elements to understand an event in detail, and interpret the displayed colors. The experience should feel coherent, complete, and intentionally designed while preserving broad creative freedom.
